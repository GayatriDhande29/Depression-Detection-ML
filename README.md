 Introduction
Depression is a common and serious mental health condition that impacts how individuals feel, 
think, and act. Machine learning (ML) provides powerful tools to analyze data, identify patterns,
and predict depression levels based on user input parameters.

 Objectives
Primary Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a person is experiencing
depression.

Scope
Inputs: Text data (by depresssion test questions )
Output: Classification of depression levels (e.g., "Depressed" or "Not Depressed") or regression scores for severity.


Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python (for ML) and JavaScript/React (for front-end).
Libraries/Frameworks:
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy.
